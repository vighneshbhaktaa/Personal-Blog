    <h1> Why I love Italy – my favourite Italy experiences and places </h1>
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> When it comes to travelling, there is no other country that has captured my heart like Italy. She has dazzling cities crammed with art and architecture, mesmerising mountains with epic lakes and hikes, breath-taking blue hues along the southern coast, and enough culture and cuisine to keep anyone entertained.

        <br>But, more than that, it’s the spirit of Italy – it’s something I can’t describe, but it’s the feeling in the air whenever I’m in the country. Sure, a lot of this is credited to the awe of the landscapes and heritage, but more than that, it’s about the people that make this nation so special. There is a degree of passion and pride in the Italian way of life that is captivating.<br>
        This is an ever-growing list as I slowly work my way around every region, but here are some of the most special Italian experiences I’ve had as a traveller, hopefully, some of these will make your next visit even more special.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Zip-wire between two mountain top villages at Castelmezzano, Basilicata</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/italy1.jpg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="100">
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Known as the Flight of the Angels, the zip-line between the villages of Castelmezzano and Pietrapertosa is a must-do adventure experience in Italy for thrill seekers. It might not be the longest zip-line in the world, but it takes in some of the most stunning scenery in the whole country. Plus, how often can you travel between villages like this?

        Even if you aren’t up for taking part, the village of Castelmezzano is one of the most beautiful in the country, with the jagged mountains protruding behind it and greenery all around, it’s well worth making a visit here regardless.  </p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Take a gelato tour through the capital of food, Bologna, Emilia-Romagna</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/italy2.jpeg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> To me, Bologna is one of the most magical cities in the country, and the friendly locals make it even more special. It’s famous for many types of food (there is more on that later), but a random claim to fame is certainly the Gelato University!

        Not to be confused with one of the oldest universities in the world, which encompasses many corners of the city. Thus, the best way to get to know Bologna well is on a walking tour, and what better thing to combine with that than Gelato?</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Experience the masks of the Venice Carnival, Veneto</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/italy3.jpeg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="100">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> It was a rainy and misty day when I arrived in Venice, which added even more mystery and intrigue to the masked characters roaming the streets.

        I’ve been lucky enough to visit Venice a few times, and while it’s certainly busy during the Carnival (when isn’t it?), it wasn’t actually as busy as the summer visits I had enjoyed previously.
        
        The Venice Carnival officially dates back to the Renaissance period, and it can be enjoyed in various ways now. From free activities such as walking the beautiful streets and admiring the costumes to attending lavish ticketed-only events and balls.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Experience a country-in-a-country at the Vatican or San Marino</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/italy4.jpeg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> There is only one country in the world that can lay claim to having two countries inside of it, and that is Italy. The only other with one country within its borders is South Africa, where Lesotho is land-locked.

        The two countries are very small, one being the smallest in the world.
        
        Exploring the Vatican is part of visiting Rome, home to the pope, and beautiful artwork and architecture when inside, it’s something worth doing in Rome just because it’s right there if for nothing else – although the lines can be quite long.<br>One of the most incredible ways to experience the Vatican and try to avoid the crowds is to book a VIP experience, where you can be some of the first people to enter the city in the morning and witness it at its most serene. Regardless of what type of St. Peter’s Basilica tickets you decide to go for, you should book them in advance to avoid long waits on the day of your visit.

        On the other hand, San Marino, surrounded by the Emilia Romagna region, is somewhere I really do recommend you visit – and stay overnight. There is some fascinating history in this micro-nation, such as having its own calendar, two presidents at a time, and its strange links with the EU and the Euro, although it’s not officially a part of it. Once the day-trippers go and sunset comes in, you’ll be rewarded with fantastic views across the landscape.</p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Learn to SUP on Lake Levico above Sparkling Wine stored below in Valsugana, Trentino</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/italy5.jpeg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> The sub-region of Valsugana in Trentino is all about watersports. Nestled just before the dolomites, the rugged terrain and peaceful lakes make for a tranquil getaway, with blue-flag beaches and plenty of boutique accommodation offerings.

        One lake, in particular, is very special, though, Lake Levico. I first discovered this lake when I learnt how to SUP, the still waters reflecting the nearby mountains made for a fantastic place to learn. Little did I know, though, that there was a secret far below the surface.<br>
        
        The famed local wine is a Sparkling option called Trento Doc, and there are bottles of the stuff underneath the water. Nearby wine-producing brother duo Andrea and Giorgio from Cantina Romanese rest their wine at the base of the lake due to the perfect temperatures and storage settings. Then, when it’s time, scuba-divers head down and retrieve the bottles. If you time your visit right, you’ll not only be able to enjoy a tasting at their intimate wine estate but maybe even witness the bottles coming back to the surface!</p>
