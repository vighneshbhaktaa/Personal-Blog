    <h1> Travel solo in the most romantic country- Switzerland! </h1>
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Mountains cast a spell on me. Hence, I’m on a constant search for finding destinations where I can live like a pahadi/ mountain girl. Having been to Austria, Scotland, Northern India and experiencing the majestic Alps and Himalayas, I still always had the itch to go to Switzerland. </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Stay in a Quaint Car-Free Village</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/swi1.jpg" alt="Switzerland" width="25" height="55">
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> I chose Wengen for my 4 night stay in the Bernese Oberland which is a car-free village 4,180 ft above sea level. It had just the right balance between quaintness and availability of eating & shopping options. A lot of tourists consider the not-so-impressive city of Interlaken (1,857 ft above sea level) as a base which is not actually in the Alps. Wengen is a 17 min train ride away from Lauterbrunnen which in turn is 20 min far from Interlaken. I could’ve easily spent a week there going nowhere but strolling around the village. Waking up to the view of the mighty Jungfrau right from my hotel balcony everyday was worth the effort it took to stay here. Other equally good option to stay is Murren (5,374 ft above sea level) which is on the opposite side of the Lauterbrunnen Valley.</p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Take Adrenaline Pumping Thrill Walks</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/swi2.jpeg" alt="Switzerland" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Switzerland is home to a few of the deadliest walks in the world. I was fortunate that there was no earthquake and the bridge didn’t fall while I was walking on the First Cliff Walk by Tissot in Grindelwald First (7,100 ft above sea level). The observation point is on a glass jutting out into a void. For a mild acrophobic person like me, it surely feels like an achievement once you reach the end and pose for a click. Another walk that I abandoned almost half way was the Thrill Walk in Birg (9,744 ft above sea level).</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Go Hiking</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/swi3.jpg" alt="Switzerland" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;">You don’t have to be fit as a fiddle or a seasoned hiker to enjoy hiking amidst the picturesque views of the Swiss Alps. I chose the easy trails in the Bernese Oberland which were within 2 hours and made sure my backpack carried a full bottle of water, sunscreen and snacks. Believe me they are life savers when you try to find signs of civilization in the middle of your trail! My first walking trail was from Allmendhubel (in Murren) to Gimmelwald which fit in beautifully in my plan to visit the villages of Gimmelwald and Murren which are on the same side of Lauterbrunnen Valley. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Ride the trains & gondolas</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/swi4.jpeg" alt="Switzerland" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> One might argue that commute can’t be regarded as an ‘activity’; it is rather the ‘down-time’. Well, this doesn’t apply in Switzerland where every train journey rewards you with such gorgeous views that you’d hardly wish the journey to get over. This is a very good option for a cold, windy, rainy day when you just want to be warm and comfortable but also not miss out on the ‘trip fun’. Since I took the Bernese Oberland Regional Pass which was the lesser known, cheaper but more useful than Swiss Pass, I had the flexibility and luxury to hop on any train or cable car free of cost during the length of my stay. </p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Explore Swiss Lake Towns</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/swi5.jpg" alt="Switzerland" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Being always drawn to the lesser known villages and towns, it takes a lot of convincing to spend my precious trip days in a big city. While I made a conscious call not to spend any time in Zurich (I landed in Zurich in the night, and left for Lucerne the next morning), I spared a day for Lucerne to enjoy the famous Kapellbrücke (Chapel Bridge) and frescoed buildings dotted across the town. Many tourists also visit Mt Rigi and Mt Pilatus from Lucerne but I skipped them in favour for higher and prettier mountains of the Jungfrau Region. On a particular rainy day, I made an unplanned visit to the lake towns of Brienz and Thun and never expected to be blown away by the Giessbach Waterfalls (pictures don’t do justice!) near Brienz. This surprise addition in my trip ended up becoming one of the highlights and one of the most cherished moments in my life. </p>
