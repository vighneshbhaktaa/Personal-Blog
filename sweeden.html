    <h1> Why I Chose Gothenburg in Sweden as the Destination for My First Solo Trip</h1>
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> I just finished my Masters, got placed in a well-reputed MNC and had a month to go before I could start my job. With my birthday around the corner, I wanted to do something offbeat to bring in my birthday this time around. So, I decided to treat myself with a solo trip to a unique destination – one that no one I knew had been to before. 
        I was done with all those college trips to Goa, Manali, Pondicherry, etc. and wanted to venture out of India this time. However, getting together the entire gang for an international trip was next to impossible due to date issues. So, I decided to travel solo for a change. One thing was certain, I was definitely going to a place no one could say, ‘Been there, done that!’</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> 1. My Destination of Choice – Gothenburg in Sweden</h2>

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> I started my research and looked up destinations around India with decent flying times. I didn’t want to go to the typical beach destination or simply one where I would only shop. I wanted to do something different and exciting each day, after all, I was going solo, so I needed to ensure I would be entertained throughout my time there. During the course of my research, I stumbled upon a city I had never heard of before – Gothenburg, or as the Swedes say it, Göteborg!</p>
    
        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> 2. Getting There</h2>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/swe2.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> The more I read, the more I was drawn to it. I quickly checked for flight connectivity before beginning to daydream about visiting Gothenburg in Sweden. Thank God for Qatar Airways and their direct flights to Gothenburg from Doha. What a relief, right? I’ve often had to pass up on visiting a destination due to the lack of flights going there. I didn’t need to do any more research on the airlines, as Qatar Airways has always been my airline of choice, for their amazing inflight services, entertainment options, warm service and, last but not the least, the delicious inflight meals. So, without much ado, I quickly booked my tickets and planned the rest of my trip. 
        I started my journey from Delhi. I first flew to Doha from Delhi with Qatar Airways, where I was able to catch my connecting flight to Gothenburg. Since Qatar Airways has 5 flights to Gothenburg each week, the great connectivity ensured I barely lost any time in transit.</p>

    <h2 style="text-align:center;"> 3. Touchdown in Gothenburg</h2>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/swe3.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;">I landed in Gothenburg in the evening and the jetlag had caught up with me by then. However, I was determined to ensure I don’t waste a single day. So, I went straight to the hotel to drop my bags off and freshen up and head out for a nice meal. I decided to start my trip on a high note, with dinner at one of the six Michelin star restaurants in the city – Bhoga. This Michelin starred restaurant specialises in Swedish gastronomy and offers a variety of delicious Swedish meals made with fresh, local ingredients. I indulged in some fresh oysters and shellfish, so much so, that I didn’t have any place left for dessert. So, I decided to talk a stroll along the canal before heading to the hotel, where I had the chance to converse with a few locals, who shared some great restaurant and gallery recommendations with me. As we chatted away, I told them about how I was visiting Gothenburg solo to celebrate the completion of MBA, my new job and my birthday of course! When Erik, one of the locals I was speaking to, discovered my birthday was at the end of the week, he instantly extended an invitation to join him and his friends for a get together at Gunnebo Manor. Truth be told, I was kind of glad that he invited me, because the thought of celebrating my birthday by myself did seem a little daunting. Since Erik insisted that I join in, I gladly accepted the offer! (Whoever said making friends can be tougher as your grow older, should visit Gothenburg  and take tips from the locals!)</p>

        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> 4. The Solo Tripping Begins</h2>

        <img src="./assets/places/swe4.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Like I said, I wanted to do something exciting each day. I started by visiting Liseberg, an amusement park in the centre of Gothenburg that’s been there since 1923. Liseberg features Scandinavia’s longest and fastest rollercoaster – Helix, AtmosFear, Europe’s largest free-fall attraction, and the best wooden rollercoaster in the world – the Balder. You simply cannot go there and miss out on these attractions. My day was spent running in between rides like the Flygis, Cyklonen and the Kaffekopparna, to name a few. </p>
    
        <h2 style="text-align:center;"> 5. The Island Escape </h2>

        <img src="./assets/places/swe5.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> After an adventurous day, I wanted to take a break and do something more relaxing the following day. So, I chose to explore the Gothenburg Archipelago, and my preferred mode of transport for the day was the humble kayak. I headed out toÖnnereds Brygga in Västra Frölunda.
        I chose the guided tour as I had never used a kayak before, and they helped me adjust to the kayak and learn paddling techniques and navigation. I kayaked around the area with quick breaks for refreshments in between. I ended the day with a dip in the pristine blue waters, followed by a meal at a quaint little restaurant by the bay! </p>
