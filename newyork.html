    <h1> Tourist attraction in New york city</h1>
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> One of the greatest cities in the world, New York is always a whirlwind of activity, with famous sites at every turn and never enough time to see them all. Some people come here to enjoy the Broadway shows; others come specifically to shop and dine; and many come simply to see the sites: the Statue of Liberty, Empire State Building, Brooklyn Bridge, Central Park, historic neighborhoods, and numerous world famous museums.

        Many of the best places to visit in New York are within walking distance of each other, or just a short ride away, making this city a delight for sightseeing.
        
        Some of the newer tourist attractions that have opened in New York in recent years, like the High Line and One World Observatory, offer unique perspectives of the city. Any time of year and any time of day or night there are an endless array of things to see and do in New York.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> HAVE A BAGEL FOR BREAKFAST</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/ny1.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="55">
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Start your day with a NYC classic, but take note: not all bagels are created equal, and most New Yorkers will claim you haven’t really tried a bagel until you’ve tried a New York bagel. While rumour has it that it is the city’s water that makes them so delicious, apparently it’s the process of boiling and then baking them that gives the bagels their signature crispy exterior and doughy centre.

        Whatever makes a bagel a “New York” bagel, there is serious debate over where to find the best ones in the city. Whether you’re getting them fresh with cream cheese from old-school Ess-A-Bagel in Midtown East, indulging in some smoked fish at the iconic Russ and Daughters on the Lower East Side, or queuing up with NYU students at Murray’s in Greenwich Village, you can’t leave New York City without trying one. </p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> SEE THE CITY SKYLINE FROM ABOVE</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/ny2.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> No matter how many times I see the New York City skyline, I never get tired of it. My own favourite skyline viewing spot is from the outdoor platform at Top of the Rock, but the Empire State Building is an icon that’s worth visiting for the history as well as the views, while the viewing observatory on the 102nd floor of One World Trade is the highest in the city. Take your pick, and brace yourself for vertigo-inducing but beautiful skyline views!</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> WATCH THE IMPOSSIBLY BRIGHT LIGHTS AT TIMES SQUARE</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/ny3.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;">No matter the time of day or night, Times Square is busy. The crowds and commercialism mean that most New Yorkers do their best to stay away from the intersection of streets known as ‘the crossroads of the world,’ but on a first visit to New York City, you simply have to experience Times Square.

        I know what it’s like to be a tourist here, and I can still remember the sheer thrill of my first sight of Times Square, when I found myself standing in the centre of these blindingly bright lights I’d watched on television for years. I was giddy with excitement, so I say yes – visit Times Square, preferably at night, and soak up the crazy atmosphere.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> ADMIRE THE CEILING AT GRAND CENTRAL TERMINAL</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/ny4.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Grand Central Terminal is more than a mere train station: it’s an iconic New York City destination in its own right. The building first opened in 1913, and sees more than 700,000 people pass through its doors every day.

        While there are countless spaces to shop, dine, and eat here, the highlight is undoubtedly the main concourse, where you can stand back and admire the elaborate painted ceiling, featuring zodiac constellations made up of thousands of stars.
        
        (Don’t miss the Whispering Gallery either: the ceilings just outside the Oyster Bar create certain acoustics that mean you can whisper to your travel partner from the other side of the room!) </p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> WALK ACROSS THE BROOKLYN BRIDGE</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/ny5.jpg" alt="ny" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> The Brooklyn Bridge, built in 1883, was the first bridge to connect Brooklyn with Manhattan, and at the time was the world’s largest suspension bridge. Today, it’s an iconic part of the New York City skyline, and the views from the pedestrian walkway are spectacular.

        While you can access the bridge from either Manhattan or Brooklyn, I always take friends to Brooklyn via the subway first, so we can stroll through the DUMBO neighbourhood and grab some food or drinks, before heading to Brooklyn Bridge Park and then finally crossing the bridge itself.
