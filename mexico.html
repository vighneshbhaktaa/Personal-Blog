    <h1> Fun things to do in Mexico city </h1>
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Mexico City is a glorious mix of contrasts, from skyscrapers and traffic-clogged highways, to cobblestone streets and colonial mansions full of character. There are traditional markets and trendy boutiques, street-side snacks and some of the world’s best restaurants. In fact, Mexico City might just be my new favourite city. </p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> SEE THE PALACIO DE BELLAS ARTES FROM ABOVE</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/mex1.jpeg" alt="mexico" width="25" height="55">
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Start in the Centro Historico. The cultural centre that is the Palace of Fine Arts was built between 1904 and 1934 – construction stopped during the Mexican Revolution – and it’s listed everywhere as one of the must-see sights in Mexico City. It’s a beautiful building – but it’s even better when viewed from above.

        We were admiring the ornate marble façade from the ground-level gardens when Mr. Stories My Suitcase Could Tell noticed what looked like a balcony in the building opposite: maybe we could see the Palacio from there? It turned out the balcony is part of a café in the Sears department store, one that offers a stunning birds-eye view of the Palacio de Bellas Artes.</p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Across the street, send a postcard in a post office that looks like a palace</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/mex2.jpeg" alt="mexico" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> It’s almost hard to believe that you can send letters at this elaborately detailed palace, but it’s been Mexico City’s central post office since it opened in 1902. Designed by the same architect who oversaw the nearby Palacio de Bellas Artes, it’s stunning, and well worth a visit for the sweeping staircases, old-school brass elevators, and intricate details. (I only wish my local post office was this impressive!)</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Stand in the Zocalo, one of the world's largest public squares</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/mex3.jpeg" alt="mexico" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;">This square has been the centre of Mexico City since it’s days as Tenochtitlan in the 1300s, when it was a space for ritual and celebration. Today, it’s also known as the Plaza de la Constitucion, and is lined by government buildings and the Metropolitan Cathedral. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Then step back in time at the Templo Mayor</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/mex4.jpg" alt="Switzerland" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> One might argue that commute can’t be regarded as an ‘activity’; it is rather the ‘down-time’. Well, this doesn’t apply in Switzerland where every train journey rewards you with such gorgeous views that you’d hardly wish the journey to get over. This is a very good option for a cold, windy, rainy day when you just want to be warm and comfortable but also not miss out on the ‘trip fun’. Since I took the Bernese Oberland Regional Pass which was the lesser known, cheaper but more useful than Swiss Pass, I had the flexibility and luxury to hop on any train or cable car free of cost during the length of my stay. </p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Explore Swiss Lake Towns</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/mex5.jpg" alt="Switzerland" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Being always drawn to the lesser known villages and towns, it takes a lot of convincing to spend my precious trip days in a big city. While I made a conscious call not to spend any time in Zurich (I landed in Zurich in the night, and left for Lucerne the next morning), I spared a day for Lucerne to enjoy the famous Kapellbrücke (Chapel Bridge) and frescoed buildings dotted across the town. Many tourists also visit Mt Rigi and Mt Pilatus from Lucerne but I skipped them in favour for higher and prettier mountains of the Jungfrau Region. On a particular rainy day, I made an unplanned visit to the lake towns of Brienz and Thun and never expected to be blown away by the Giessbach Waterfalls (pictures don’t do justice!) near Brienz. This surprise addition in my trip ended up becoming one of the highlights and one of the most cherished moments in my life. </p>
