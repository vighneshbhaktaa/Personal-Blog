    <h1> Adventurous things to do in Chiang Mai</h1>
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Surrounded by lush mountains and dotted with historic temples, Chiang Mai is the best hub for exploring northern Thailand. This city has a rare combination of adventure, nature, culture, history, food, and modern comforts; a blend that makes it one of our favorite cities in the world.</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Climb up "Sticky waterfalls"</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/thai1.jpeg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="55">
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Most waterfalls you think of are extremely slippery due to the massive build up of mossy rocks or fast moving water. The Bua Thong Waterfalls (also known as “Sticky Waterfalls”) are unique because they are fed by a spring rich in minerals.

        Due to the mineral deposits in the water, the rocks have become porous and slightly spongey, allowing you to walk up them with bare feet (perfect for anyone with “wandering soles”! Haha!)
        
        There are a couple sections to the tiered-waterfall, but our favorite was at the very bottom where the falls drop about thirty feet and you are able to climb around them. It’s a great way to cool down on a hot day! 
        
        After you’re done playing the falls, head up the small set of stairs opposite of the falls which leads to the source of the spring. The spring itself is a deep hole filled with vibrant blue water. 
        
        Read our complete guide to visiting Sticky Waterfalls (Bua Tong) for directions on how to get there and what to expect. </p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Hike the Pilgrim’s path to a jungle temple</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/thai2.jpg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> There are dozens of temples in Chiang Mai, but Wat Pha Lat is our favorite temple we’ve visited by far.

        First, it is surrounded by the jungle, so it has a completely different feel than the temples within the Old City. Second, it can only be reached by hiking, which eliminates many tourists. The crowds at Wat Pha Lat are far fewer than at many of the other temples in Chiang Mai, so it feels really special. After an easy 30 – 40-minute hike on the Pilgrim’s Path, you’ll be rewarded with bamboo forests, the sound of chirping birds, a trickling waterfall, and monks completing their daily chores. Allow yourself at least 30 minutes to wander around, take photos and enjoy this beautiful place.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Get soaked at Songkran celebrations</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/thai3.jpg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;">Songkran, or Thai New Year, is celebrated in April. (The exact date changes, as it follows the lunar calendar.)

        If you’re planning to visit Chiang Mai for Songkran, get ready for a festival you’ll never forget! Songkran lasts for 3 days, and the whole city plays along. Everyone carries water guns and buckets, and there is no way you can walk down a street without getting wet.
        
        As long as you’ve got your phone protected, you’re in for an incredible time. Families will drive down the street with the bed of their pickup truck lined with plastic and filled with water, creating a makeshift “pool”. Kids or teenagers sitting in the back will find every opportunity to douse passersby with buckets of water. </p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Splash around at the Chiang Mai Grand Canyon</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/thai4.jpeg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> I’ve visited the Chiang Mai Grand Canyon twice — once in 2015 and again in 2019 — and boy oh boy has it changed! What used to be a sort of hidden secret is now super built up, and it’s certainly not off-the-beaten-path anymore.

        Back in the day (aka 2015 and before), this old quarry was a haven for backpackers looking for an adventurous and cheap way to spend the day. There was one small cafe onsite and it cost 50 baht ($1.60 USD) to enter, and this fee included a complimentary drink.
        
        From there, you were on your own. Locals hung out and dove off cliffs — some as tall as 15 meters (50 feet). There were a couple of rickety bamboo rafts to float on, and that was pretty much it.</p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> See Elephants in Chiang Mai the responsible way</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/thai5.jpeg" alt="Italy" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Seeing an elephant up close is on pretty much everyone’s bucket list in Thailand. But before you delve into where to see elephants in Chiang Mai, you are going over some very important things to consider when you book your elephant experience. If you just skim this section over and don’t do much research, your actions can actually be very harmful to the elephants you just wanna cuddle. 
        Today, many travelers are educated about why you should not ride elephants, and instead decide to visit “elephant sanctuaries” while on vacation in Thailand. While this is a great shift, there are some things you should know before you book just any “sanctuary”…

Here’s a little insight I’ve learned while living in Chiang Mai: As the demand for sanctuaries grows, there are unfortunately some places that are capitalizing on this and calling themselves “sanctuaries” without truly doing what’s right for the elephants. 

I’ve heard stories that after tourists leave, the way they treat their animals (and staff members) isn’t always great.
