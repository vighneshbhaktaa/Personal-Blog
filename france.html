    <h1> Epic tips for travelling alone in France</h1>
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Travelling alone in France is one of the most incredible travel experiences you can have!

        The country has a rich culture, a variety of architecture depending where in the country you are, and it is super easy to travel alone in France.</p>
    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Get Outside of Paris</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/fran1.jpg" alt="France" width="25" height="55">
    
    <p style="font: size 30px;"> One of the biggest mistakes you can make on your trip to France (whether you’re alone in France or with a group) is staying in Paris the entire time.

        I definitely made this mistake the first time I visited France, and I regret it.
        
        Don’t be like me!
        
        Paris is just a small slice of France, and the rest of the country has so much to offer! Every area of France is unique and a different experience.
        
        As with many of the major cities in the world, Paris doesn’t give you a genuine sense of what France is like.
        
        It is a taste of France, but you have to try more than one dish to get the full experience!
        
        If you don’t have a lot of time in France or you’re nervous about travelling between cities, taking a day trip from Paris is a great option.
        
        You will be surprised at how different somewhere just an hour or two outside Paris is from the capital city.
        
        Especially if you choose your destination properly!
        
        In a perfect world, you would spend at least a weekend outside of Paris, but I know that isn’t possible.
        
        But please, please, please make sure you get outside Paris for at least one day on your solo trip to France!</p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Learn a Little Bit of French</h3>
    
    

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> I’m sure you’ve heard the stereotypes that French people are rude and don’t like tourists.

        That is 100% a myth. I’ve had nothing but incredibly positive experiences when in France.
        
        That being said, it is very important to know a few key French words when visiting France.
        
        I’ve found that French people are extremely appreciative of you trying to speak a little bit of their language.
        
        Even if you’re not very good at it!
        
        Simple things like knowing how to say hello, good-bye, and thank you in French goes a long way in France.
        
        The more you know the better!
        
        And be polite!
        
        Kindness goes a long way anywhere you go, and that is no different in France.
        
        You have to remember as a traveller that nobody is obligated to speak in their second or third language to accommodate your language skills.
        
        It is a kindness that people do, and we shouldn’t take it for granted.
        
        I’m certainly very grateful when people speak English for me when I’m in their country! I know how privileged I am to be afforded that convenience.
        
        Communication is give and take.</p>

    <h3 style="text-align:center;"> France is Safe for Solo Travellers</h3>
    
    <img src="./assets/places/fran2.jpg" alt="France" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;">One of the first things people who are travelling to France alone Google is whether or not the country is safe for solo travellers.

        Especially for solo female travellers.
        
        I’m here to put your nerves at ease and tell you that France is very safe for solo travellers!
        
        I’ve never had an issue travelling alone in France.
        
        You still need to be aware of local scams (pick pocketing can be a major issue in Paris), but you’re no more at risk as a solo traveller than if you were in a group.
        
        If you’re aware of your surroundings and have your wits about you, you should have no issue travelling alone in France!
        
        And if you’re ever in a situation where you start to feel a bit uncomfortable, listen to your gut and turn around.
        
        Or scurry home as quickly as possible if you’re on your way back to your hotel.
        
        You probably won’t feel uncomfortable as a solo traveller in France, and it is a very safe country for tourists.
        
        Just be aware of those pick pocketers and keep your valuables safely stored in your bag and out of reach!</p>

        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> But It Can Feel a Bit Sketchy at Night</h3>

        

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Okay, okay. I know this kind of goes against my last point, but hear me out.

        The only time I’ve felt even the slightest bit uncomfortable alone in France is at night.
        
        I’m not normally one to stay out past dark, but I was coming home from a hockey game and had no choice.
        
        I’m specifically thinking about Paris. The streets are kind of eery to me at night, and I can’t quite place my finger on why.
        
        There isn’t any reason to be afraid or feel sketched out, but I know quite a few people who hate walking outside in the evening in Paris.
        
        Even my dad hates it!
        
        I’m not saying you shouldn’t be out after dark. I just want you to be prepared to maybe have your heart beat a little faster and feel the need to walk a little bit faster.
        
        It isn’t everywhere in France, but I’ve found that some of the larger cities have the same after dark vibe that makes my heart race.
        
        You may have a different experience though!
        
        I just want to give you my experience, so you can be a little bit more prepared if you are out and about at night.
        
        But definitely take the metro to as close to where you’re going as possible!</p>
    
        <h3 style="text-align:center;"> Buy Your Train Tickets in Advance</h3>

        <img src="./assets/places/fran3.jpg" alt="France" width="25" height="50">

    <p style="font: size 30px;"> Not buying your train tickets in advance is one of the biggest mistakes anybody who visits France can make.

        I’ve made the mistake too many times in the past, and my wallet hurts because of it.
        
        Many places in Europe (France included) determine the price of a train ticket around when you purchase your ticket.
        
        The earlier you purchase your ticket, the less expensive it is. Leave buying your ticket until the last minute, your wallet is going to hurt like mine does!
        
        I know not everybody likes to pre-plan their trips (me included!), but you should definitely pre-plan and purchase your train tickets in France.
        
        I’m not talking about the ticket prices going up by a few Euros closer to the day of departure.
        
        I’m talking the price difference could be €50 to €100 more!
        
        I’ve had to not go on a day trip from Paris because I didn’t book my train ticket in advance, and it was too expensive.
        
        Like it was going to be over €300 round-trip for a two-hour train ride each way!
        
        So, learn from my mistakes and book your train tickets early!
        
        I know this isn’t exactly a tip for travelling alone in France, but I need you to know this! It’ll make your France trip go so much smoother and save you a ton of money.
        
        Especially if you’re visiting multiple cities on your trip!</p>
